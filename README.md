# Fuzzing in the open

## Description

This repository contains all materials used for the "*Fuzzing in the open: Integrate your project in OSS-Fuzz for continuous fuzzing*" workshop at [the Ubuntu Summit 2024](https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/540/). It includes the presentation, Mermaid.js diagrams, and practical files used to guide participants through the process of integrating their own projects with [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz).

## Abstract

> “12,000 bugs in open-source software written mostly in memory-unsafe languages.”
> 
> This is a line that will capture the attention of an application security engineer. While one might question the validity of this information, it is indeed the truth. This is the number of bugs discovered by OSS-Fuzz, a service provided by Google to fuzz critical open-source projects.
> 
> Join our dynamic and hands-on workshop to learn how to integrate your open-source projects with OSS-Fuzz. By the end, you’ll be equipped to:
> 
> - Understand what fuzzing is and how OSS-Fuzz works.
> - Run fuzzers locally on their development hosts.
> - Write fuzzing harnesses.
> - Investigate crashes to find their root cause.
> - Write and submit patches for the vulnerable code.
> 
> The workshop features real-world success stories from the Linux printing backbone, OpenPrinting, highlighting its seamless integration with OSS-Fuzz thanks to a Google Summer of Code contributor.
> 
> Intrigued? Join us to help increase the number of bugs detected by OSS-Fuzz by participating in the workshop and starting to fuzz your projects!
